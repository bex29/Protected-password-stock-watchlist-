          <p class="content">
            Hi! I am Takhmina, a passionate web developer and UX/UI designer. 
            I decided to study CS because I have always enjoyed coding and decided 
            to make it my career. I am planning to focus on AI and ML in the future
            years. I am excited to finish my first year and get an internship where
            I can broaden my knowledge and gain valuable experience.
            <br><br>
         
            Besides coding and designing, I enjoy playing guitar, singing, and writing.
           I hope you like our project! Please feel free to get in touch on LinkedIn 
           and say hi!ðŸ‘‹

            As a passionate and driven computer science student, I am dedicated
            to expanding my knowledge and skills in the field of technology.
            Through my studies and personal projects, I have gained expertise in
            programming languages such as Java, Python, and C++, as well as
            experience in software development, data analysis, and algorithm
            design.
            <br /><br />I am always eager to learn new concepts and stay
            up-to-date with the latest advancements in technology, and I thrive
            in fast-paced environments that challenge me to think creatively and
            innovatively. I am a team player who enjoys collaborating with
            others to develop solutions to complex problems, and I am always
            willing to lend a helping hand to my peers. <br /><br />In addition
            to my technical skills, I possess excellent communication and
            problem-solving abilities, which enable me to explain technical
            concepts to non-technical stakeholders and work effectively with
            diverse teams. I am excited to apply my skills and knowledge to
            create innovative solutions and make a positive impact in the tech
            industry.
