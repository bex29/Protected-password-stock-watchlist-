No major issues were encountered during the development of the project. 

All of the functional requirements were implemented as planned.

All of the instructions in the project PDF were followed and none of the rules were broken.

All of the teammates were having fun and being productive. 

We learnt a lot and this has been a hugely productive semester for us. Thank you so much
